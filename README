stppResid

This repository contains the R code source files, data, and documentation for the stppResid R package.

stppResid stands for "space-time point process residual analysis". The package contains functions for 
defining a space-time point process (stpp) object, and performing residual analysis using a user defined
function for the conditional intensity. 

Residual analysis for space-time point processes can be broken down into two general schemes:

1) Pixel-based residuals
2) Transformation-based residuals

See references in the help files. Perhaps I will write a vignette for this package...someday.

The transformation-based residual functions are fairly quick, but the pixel-based residuals can be very 
slow because the 3-dimensional integrals must be approximated. The speed of these functions can be improved
if the conditional intensity function is not very complex (for example, a Hawkes process might be slow). 


Future suggested improvements:
1. Currently, the package only works for rectangular spatial regions. A future update should add support
for polygonal regions.

2. The integral approximation accuracy and speed can be improved. The accuracy can be poor for discontinuous conditional 
intensity functions, and the speed can be slow, especially with large datasets.
